      <h1>A little about productivity</h1>

      <strong>Why you study less effective at home?</strong>
      <p>Nowadays, during quarantine more and more people are trying to make
their best in productivity, and try to go out of their comfort zone. What
comfort zone actually is? In order to answer this question I'd like to give
an example from our daily life, so you can observe that when you are at
home, you know that you are able to lay down and do nothing,
procrastinate and so on. So the reason is that you are staying in your
comfort zone, it could be your home, house of your grandparents and
every other familiar place</p>
<p>Personally, I am trying to leave my house in order to study my C, ICT
labs, or to prepare for SAT's, and I realized how my productivity and
intention to study raised after I got a few study sessions in coffee
houses, which are so unfamiliar for me, as soon as I'm not really that
outgoing person. So after that, I noticed that the place where we study
has some psychological affect on our intentions, effectivity and so on.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, not everyone can afford daily study sessions in coffee
houses, for those guys, I'd like to recommend libraries, or some public
places where you can have access to tables and ability to juice up your
device. I got some sessions in library which were great, they have a lot
of comfortable locations throughout library, free wifi and also it was free.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I'd like to say that your efficiency first of all depends on
your intention, and then on other factors mentioned above.
